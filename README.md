# Titanic Dataset Analysis
## Overview
  This project analyzes the Titanic dataset using Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn) to understand data patterns and factors affecting survival.

## What I Did
  Generated summary statistics for numeric features.

  Created histograms and boxplots for data distribution.

  Explored relationships using correlation matrix and pairplots.

  Identified key trends like class and fare impact on survival.

## How to Run
  Install dependencies: pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn

  Run the provided script or notebook to reproduce the analysis.

## Key Insights
  Higher class and fare linked with better survival.

  Age less strongly correlated.

Some data missing, especially Age and Cabin.
